The change clarifies that the lock is specifically for Lucene soft-deleted documents, removing the mention of translog files. This is a positive update for clarity, but it is essential to ensure that the implementation aligns with this documentation change.\n\nSpecific Issues:\n1. **Line 2654**: The documentation now states that the lock is only for Lucene soft-deleted documents. If the method's functionality still involves translog files, this could lead to confusion or misinterpretation. Ensure that the implementation of `getEngine().acquireHistoryRetentionLock()` does not involve translog files, or update the documentation accordingly to reflect the complete scope of the lock.\n\n2. **Documentation Clarity**: While the change improves clarity, consider adding a brief explanation of why the lock is necessary for soft-deleted documents. This could help future developers understand the importance of this lock in the context of data integrity and retention.\n\n3. **Code Style**: The comment style is consistent with Java documentation practices, but consider using `@return` or `@throws` tags if applicable, to provide more context about what the method returns or any exceptions it might throw.\n\nNo performance issues, security vulnerabilities, or edge cases are apparent from this diff alone, but the implementation of the `acquireHistoryRetentionLock` method should be reviewed to ensure it aligns with the updated documentation.\n\nIn summary, ensure that the documentation accurately reflects the method's functionality and consider enhancing it for clarity.\n\n\n---\n*This review was automatically generated by an AI assistant.*",

However, there are a few points worth noting:\n\n1. **Documentation Clarity**:\n   - **Line 2654**: The comment was changed to specify that the lock is only on \"Lucene soft-deleted documents.\" If the original comment was accurate in stating that it also acquired a lock on \"translog files,\" this change could lead to confusion. Ensure that the new comment accurately reflects the functionality of the method. If the lock does indeed cover translog files, the comment should not be modified.\n\n2. **Code Style and Best Practices**:\n   - The comment should ideally mention the implications of acquiring the lock, such as potential performance impacts or the need for proper handling of the `Closeable` returned by the method. This could help future developers understand the importance of this method better.\n\n3. **Potential Edge Cases**:\n   - If the locking mechanism is only on soft-deleted documents, consider whether there are scenarios where this could lead to issues if translog files are not protected. If there are any edge cases where the absence of a lock on translog files could lead to data inconsistency or corruption, this should be documented or addressed.\n\nIn summary, while the change improves clarity, it is crucial to ensure that the documentation accurately reflects the method's behavior. If the lock does indeed cover translog files, the comment should be reverted to its original form. If not, additional context should be provided to explain the implications of the change.\n\n\n---\n*This review was automatically generated by an AI assistant.*",
