This is a common practice for rate limiting, and the implementation appears to be straightforward. However, there are a few points to consider:\n\n1. **Bugs or Logical Errors**:\n   - No bugs or logical errors are apparent in the new condition added for status code 429.\n\n2. **Performance Issues**:\n   - There are no performance issues introduced by this change. The addition of a new condition does not impact performance negatively.\n\n3. **Security Vulnerabilities**:\n   - No security vulnerabilities are evident in this change. However, ensure that the `buildError` method does not expose sensitive information in the error message.\n\n4. **Code Style and Best Practices**:\n   - The code follows standard practices for handling HTTP status codes. However, consider adding a comment above the new condition to explain why a `RetryException` is thrown for status code 429, as this can help future maintainers understand the rationale.\n\n5. **Potential Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure that the `RetryException` handling logic elsewhere in the codebase appropriately manages retries for this status code. It may be beneficial to document the expected behavior when a 429 status is encountered, such as the backoff strategy or maximum retry attempts.\n\nIn summary, the change is well-implemented, but adding a comment for clarity and ensuring proper handling of the `RetryException` in the broader context would enhance maintainability.\n\n**Specific Issues**:\n- **Line 41**: Consider adding a comment explaining the rationale for handling status code 429.\n\nOverall, the code looks good with minor suggestions for improvement.\n\n\n---\n*This review was automatically generated by an AI assistant.*",

This is a common practice for rate limiting scenarios. However, there are a few points to consider:\n\n1. **Error Handling Consistency**: \n   - Line 42: The new handling for status code 429 is consistent with the existing error handling for other status codes. However, ensure that the `RATE_LIMIT` constant is defined and meaningful in the context of your application. If it is not defined, this will lead to a compilation error.\n\n2. **Documentation**:\n   - It would be beneficial to add comments explaining the rationale behind handling the 429 status code. This will help future maintainers understand the purpose of this addition.\n\n3. **Logging**:\n   - Consider adding logging for the 429 status code before throwing the exception. This can help in monitoring and debugging issues related to rate limiting.\n\n4. **Testing**:\n   - Ensure that there are unit tests covering this new code path. Specifically, tests should verify that a 429 status code results in a `RetryException` being thrown with the correct parameters.\n\n5. **Performance**:\n   - There are no immediate performance issues with this change, but be mindful of how often 429 responses are expected. If they are frequent, consider implementing exponential backoff strategies in the retry logic to avoid overwhelming the server.\n\nIn summary, while the code change is a good addition, consider enhancing documentation, logging, and testing to ensure robustness and maintainability.\n\n\n---\n*This review was automatically generated by an AI assistant.*",
