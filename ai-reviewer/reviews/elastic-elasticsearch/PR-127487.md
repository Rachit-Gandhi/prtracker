## Summary
This pull request addresses the handling of retries for rate-limited non-streaming requests to the Elastic Inference Service. The primary purpose of the changes is to enhance the robustness of the service by implementing a retry mechanism that can effectively manage situations where requests are throttled due to rate limits.

The significant modification in this PR is found in the `ElasticInferenceServiceResponseHandler.java` file, where 2 lines of code have been added. These additions likely introduce logic to detect rate-limiting responses and initiate retries accordingly, although the specific implementation details are not provided in the summary.

While the addition of retry logic is a positive enhancement, potential concerns include ensuring that the retry mechanism does not lead to excessive load on the service or create cascading failures if the underlying issue persists. It would be beneficial to implement exponential backoff strategies for retries and to set a maximum retry limit to prevent infinite loops. Additionally, thorough testing should be conducted to verify that the new logic behaves as expected under various rate-limiting scenarios.

Overall, this PR represents a valuable improvement to the Elastic Inference Service, but careful consideration of the retry strategy and its implications is essential for maintaining service stability.

## Detailed Review

### x-pack/plugin/inference/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/xpack/inference/services/elastic/ElasticInferenceServiceResponseHandler.java
Overall, the code diff introduces a new condition to handle HTTP status code 429 (Too Many Requests) by throwing a `RetryException`. This is a common practice for rate limiting, and the implementation appears to be straightforward. However, there are a few points to consider:

1. **Bugs or Logical Errors**:
   - No bugs or logical errors are apparent in the new condition added for status code 429.

2. **Performance Issues**:
   - There are no performance issues introduced by this change. The addition of a new condition does not impact performance negatively.

3. **Security Vulnerabilities**:
   - No security vulnerabilities are evident in this change. However, ensure that the `buildError` method does not expose sensitive information in the error message.

4. **Code Style and Best Practices**:
   - The code follows standard practices for handling HTTP status codes. However, consider adding a comment above the new condition to explain why a `RetryException` is thrown for status code 429, as this can help future maintainers understand the rationale.

5. **Potential Edge Cases**:
   - Ensure that the `RetryException` handling logic elsewhere in the codebase appropriately manages retries for this status code. It may be beneficial to document the expected behavior when a 429 status is encountered, such as the backoff strategy or maximum retry attempts.

In summary, the change is well-implemented, but adding a comment for clarity and ensuring proper handling of the `RetryException` in the broader context would enhance maintainability.

**Specific Issues**:
- **Line 41**: Consider adding a comment explaining the rationale for handling status code 429.

Overall, the code looks good with minor suggestions for improvement.
