## Summary
This pull request (PR) aims to enable the `FAILURE_STORE` feature flag for the `LogsIndexModeFullClusterRestartIT` integration test in Elasticsearch. The primary purpose of this change is to enhance the testing framework by ensuring that the `FAILURE_STORE` functionality is properly validated during full cluster restart scenarios.

Significant modifications include updates to two files: 
1. **muted-tests.yml**: This file has been modified to remove three entries, likely indicating that certain tests are no longer muted, allowing them to run and be validated with the new feature flag enabled.
2. **LogsIndexModeFullClusterRestartIT.java**: This test file has seen four additions and one deletion, which may involve new assertions or configurations to accommodate the `FAILURE_STORE` feature.

Potential concerns include ensuring that the newly enabled tests do not introduce instability or false positives in the testing suite. It is crucial to verify that the tests run successfully across various scenarios and that the `FAILURE_STORE` feature behaves as expected under full cluster restart conditions. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include documentation or comments explaining the rationale behind the changes for future reference. Overall, the PR appears to be a positive step towards improving test coverage and reliability in the Elasticsearch codebase.

## Detailed Review

### muted-tests.yml
Overall Assessment:
The code diff shows a modification to a YAML file where a test case has been removed. There are no apparent bugs, performance issues, or security vulnerabilities in the provided diff. However, the removal of the test case should be justified, and it is important to ensure that it does not affect the overall test coverage.

Specific Issues:
1. **Line 249-251**: The removal of the test case for `org.elasticsearch.upgrades.LogsIndexModeFullClusterRestartIT` could lead to a gap in testing for upgrade scenarios. Ensure that this test is no longer needed or that its functionality is covered elsewhere. If it is being removed due to a known issue, consider documenting the reason for its removal in comments.

2. **Documentation**: There is no comment or documentation explaining why the test case was removed. It is a good practice to include a comment in the YAML file to provide context for future maintainers.

3. **Test Coverage**: Verify that the removal of this test does not reduce the overall test coverage for the upgrade scenarios. If there are no other tests covering similar functionality, consider keeping this test or adding a new one.

In summary, while the diff itself does not contain any direct issues, the implications of removing a test case should be carefully considered and documented.
### qa/full-cluster-restart/src/javaRestTest/java/org/elasticsearch/upgrades/LogsIndexModeFullClusterRestartIT.java
Overall, the code diff appears to be a straightforward modification to include a feature flag in the Elasticsearch cluster setup. However, there are a few points worth noting:

1. **Code Style and Best Practices**:
   - Line 48: The semicolon at the end of the `.feature(FeatureFlag.FAILURE_STORE_ENABLED);` line is unnecessary. The method chaining style typically does not require a semicolon after the last method call in a fluent interface. Removing it would enhance readability.

2. **Potential Edge Cases**:
   - While the addition of the feature flag seems appropriate, it would be prudent to ensure that the feature flag `FAILURE_STORE_ENABLED` is compatible with the existing cluster configuration and does not introduce any unexpected behavior. It would be beneficial to have tests that validate the behavior of the cluster with this feature flag enabled.

3. **Documentation**:
   - It may be helpful to add a comment explaining why the `FAILURE_STORE_ENABLED` feature flag is being enabled. This can aid future developers in understanding the rationale behind this configuration.

4. **Version Compatibility**:
   - Ensure that the feature flag is supported in the versions of Elasticsearch that this test is intended to run against. If `FAILURE_STORE_ENABLED` is not available in certain versions, it could lead to runtime errors.

In summary, while the change is minor and seems to be in line with the intended functionality, addressing the points above would improve the code quality and maintainability. 

### Specific Issues:
- **Line 48**: Remove the unnecessary semicolon after the feature flag method call.
- **Documentation**: Consider adding a comment for clarity on the purpose of enabling the feature flag.

Overall, the change is acceptable with minor adjustments.
