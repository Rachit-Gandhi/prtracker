## Summary
This pull request aims to enhance the documentation for the `acquireHistoryRetentionLock` method in the `IndexShard` class by removing references to "translog" from the Javadoc. The purpose of this change is to clarify the method's functionality and ensure that the documentation accurately reflects its current behavior without unnecessary terminology that may confuse users.

The significant modification includes a single addition and a deletion in the Javadoc comment associated with the `acquireHistoryRetentionLock` method. This adjustment is intended to improve the clarity and relevance of the documentation, making it easier for developers to understand the method's purpose and usage.

One potential concern is whether the removal of "translog" might lead to a loss of important context for users who are familiar with the previous implementation. It would be beneficial to ensure that the updated documentation still provides sufficient detail about the method's role within the broader context of the `IndexShard` class and its interaction with other components. Additionally, it may be worthwhile to consider adding examples or further explanations to enhance user comprehension.

Overall, this PR contributes to better documentation practices, but careful consideration should be given to maintaining clarity and context for users.

## Detailed Review

### server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/index/shard/IndexShard.java
Overall Assessment:
The code diff shows a minor change in the documentation comment for the `acquireHistoryRetentionLock` method. The change clarifies that the lock is specifically for Lucene soft-deleted documents, removing the mention of translog files. This is a positive update for clarity, but it is essential to ensure that the implementation aligns with this documentation change.

Specific Issues:
1. **Line 2654**: The documentation now states that the lock is only for Lucene soft-deleted documents. If the method's functionality still involves translog files, this could lead to confusion or misinterpretation. Ensure that the implementation of `getEngine().acquireHistoryRetentionLock()` does not involve translog files, or update the documentation accordingly to reflect the complete scope of the lock.

2. **Documentation Clarity**: While the change improves clarity, consider adding a brief explanation of why the lock is necessary for soft-deleted documents. This could help future developers understand the importance of this lock in the context of data integrity and retention.

3. **Code Style**: The comment style is consistent with Java documentation practices, but consider using `@return` or `@throws` tags if applicable, to provide more context about what the method returns or any exceptions it might throw.

No performance issues, security vulnerabilities, or edge cases are apparent from this diff alone, but the implementation of the `acquireHistoryRetentionLock` method should be reviewed to ensure it aligns with the updated documentation.

In summary, ensure that the documentation accurately reflects the method's functionality and consider enhancing it for clarity.
